# raceDay
A program that allocated runners to time slots for thier races. The time slots are allocated depending on time of registration and Age. Also automatically produce their race numbers.

Here’s how the registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.
Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
But we didn’t plan for runners that are exactly 18!
